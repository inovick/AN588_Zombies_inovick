## Loading the data
```{r}
library("curl")
library("ggplot2")
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
#getting the data from github using curl

```{r}

```
